New methods to compare with:  
  - [ ] Sneyd and Stevenson, SIGIR 2021. Only implement IP-P, code is available [here](https://github.com/alisonsneyd/stopping_criteria_counting_processes/blob/main/run_stopping_point_experiments.ipynb). Should be pretty easy to do.
  - [ ] Lewis et al., CIKM 2021. They propose _Quantile Point Estimate Threshold_ (QPET), and _Quantile Binomial Confidence 
  Bound_ (QBCB). Code is **not** available :(. I would only implement QBCB, since it's also the one the authors mostly experiment with. Asked E. Yang for the code, if we cannot have it/republish it I would honestly only implement Sneyd and Stevenson's.
